```

### 2. Check Console for Errors
```
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any red error messages
4. Take note of any missing files or JavaScript errors
```

### 3. Run Debug Information

2. Press Enter
3. This will show you the status of all game components
```

## 🐛 **Common GitHub Pages Issues & Solutions**

### **Issue: Main Menu is Black/Empty**
**Symptoms**: Page loads but no 3D diamond or interactive elements
**Causes**: 
- Three.js failed to load
- 3D scene initialization failed
- JavaScript errors preventing setup

**Solutions**:
1. Check console for "Three.js not loaded" errors
2. Verify CDN links are working (Three.js, Anime.js)
3. Run `debugInfo()` to see component status

### **Issue: "Cannot read property of undefined" Errors**
**Symptoms**: JavaScript errors in console mentioning undefined properties
**Causes**:
- Script loading order issues
- Missing dependencies
- Async initialization problems

**Solutions**:
1. Check if all scripts are loading in correct order
2. Verify no 404 errors for JavaScript files
3. Check network tab for failed resource loads

### **Issue: Game Doesn't Respond to Clicks**
**Symptoms**: Can see the menu but clicking doesn't work
**Causes**:
- Event handlers not properly attached
- Audio context issues
- Game manager not initialized

**Solutions**:
1. Check console for audio context errors
2. Try clicking multiple times (some browsers need multiple interactions)
3. Run `debugInfo()` to check game manager status

### **Issue: Service Worker Errors**
**Symptoms**: Console shows service worker registration failures
**Causes**:
- HTTPS requirement for service workers
- Caching conflicts
- File path issues

**Solutions**:
1. Service workers only work on HTTPS (GitHub Pages uses HTTPS)
2. Clear application cache in Dev Tools → Application → Storage → Clear Site Data
3. Disable service worker temporarily for testing

## 🛠️ **Step-by-Step Debugging Process**

### Step 1: Basic Functionality Test
```javascript
// Run in console:
debugInfo()
```
This should show all components as loaded.

### Step 2: Check Three.js Loading
```javascript
// Run in console:
console.log('Three.js loaded:', typeof THREE !== 'undefined');
console.log('Three.js version:', THREE?.REVISION);
```

### Step 3: Manual Scene Initialization
```javascript
// If 3D scene isn't working, try:
if (window.initMainMenuScene) {
    window.initMainMenuScene();
}
```

### Step 4: Check Game Manager
```javascript
// Run in console:
console.log('Game Manager:', window.gameManager);
console.log('Sound Manager:', window.soundManager);
console.log('Main Menu Scene:', window.mainMenuScene);
```

## 📱 **Mobile-Specific Issues**

### Audio Context Issues
- Mobile browsers require user interaction before audio works
- Solution: Click anywhere on the main menu to enable audio

### Viewport Issues
- Mobile browsers handle viewport differently
- Solution: Already handled with CSS viewport fixes

### Touch Events
- Some mobile browsers need specific touch event handling
- Solution: Universal event listeners already implemented

## 🔧 **Advanced Troubleshooting**

### Clear All Caches
1. **Browser Cache**: Ctrl+Shift+R
2. **Service Worker Cache**: Dev Tools → Application → Storage → Clear Site Data
3. **CDN Cache**: Wait 5-10 minutes for CDN updates

### Disable Service Worker Temporarily
```javascript
// Run in console to unregister service worker:
navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(registrations => {
    registrations.forEach(registration => registration.unregister());
});
```

### Check Network Loading
1. Open Dev Tools → Network tab
2. Refresh page
3. Look for any red (failed) requests
4. Check if all JS files are loading successfully

## 📞 **Getting More Help**

### Information to Gather:
1. Browser and version (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)
2. Device type (Desktop, Mobile, Tablet)
3. Console error messages (copy/paste full errors)
4. Output from `debugInfo()` function
5. Screenshot of Network tab showing any failed requests

### Common Error Messages & Meanings:

**"THREE is not defined"**
- Three.js CDN failed to load
- Check internet connection and CDN availability

**"Cannot read property 'init' of undefined"**
- Game components not properly initialized
- Check script loading order

**"Audio context suspended"**
- Normal on mobile, requires user interaction
- Click anywhere to resolve

**"Service Worker registration failed"**
- Not critical for game functionality
- Can be ignored if other features work

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

When working correctly, you should see:
1. **Loading screen** with spinner (briefly)
2. **3D animated diamond** on dark background
3. **"THE SPY ACADEMY"** title text
4. **"Click Anywhere to Begin"** subtitle
5. **Responsive to clicks** - advances to player selection
