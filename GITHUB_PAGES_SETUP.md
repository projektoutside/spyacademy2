# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide

## The Spy Academy - Escape Room Game

This guide will help you deploy your escape room game to GitHub Pages so it works perfectly when live.

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

The following files have been optimized for GitHub Pages:

- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Prevents Jekyll processing
- ✅ `manifest.json` - Updated for proper PWA support
- ✅ `sw.js` - Enhanced service worker for production
- ✅ `index.html` - Production-ready with error handling
- ✅ All external resources use HTTPS
- ✅ Proper error handling for production environments

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub Repository

1. Commit all your files to your GitHub repository
2. Ensure all the game files are in the root directory of your repository

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on "Settings" tab
3. Scroll down to "Pages" section in the left sidebar
4. Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
5. Choose "main" branch (or "master" if that's your default)
6. Select "/ (root)" as the folder
7. Click "Save"

### 3. Wait for Deployment

- GitHub Pages will take a few minutes to deploy
- Your site will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/repositoryname`

## 🔧 Production Features

The game now includes several production-ready features:

### Service Worker
- Caches all game assets for offline play
- Handles network failures gracefully
- Improves loading times on repeat visits

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks for missing components
- Production vs development environment detection
- User-friendly error messages

### Performance Optimizations
- Optimized loading sequence
- Better resource management
- Mobile device optimizations

### Security
- HTTPS enforcement
- Content Security Policy headers
- Secure external resource loading

## 🌐 Testing Your Live Site

Once deployed, test these features:

1. **Initial Load**: Game should load smoothly on first visit
2. **Audio**: Volume controls and sound effects work properly
3. **Mobile**: Touch controls and responsive design function correctly
4. **Offline**: Site should work after loading once (thanks to service worker)
5. **PWA**: Site should be installable on mobile devices

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions:

#### "Site not loading"
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Ensure main branch is selected as source
- Wait 5-10 minutes for initial deployment

#### "Audio not working"
- Modern browsers require user interaction before audio can play
- Click anywhere on the main menu to enable audio
- Check browser console for audio context errors

#### "Game components not loading"
- Check browser console for 404 errors on JavaScript files
- Ensure all files are committed to the repository
- Verify file paths are correct (case-sensitive on GitHub Pages)

#### "Service Worker errors"
- Service Worker only registers on HTTPS (production)
- Clear browser cache and reload if having caching issues
- Check browser developer tools > Application > Service Workers

### Debug Mode

To enable debug logging:
1. Open browser developer tools
2. Set `localStorage.debug = 'true'` in console
3. Reload the page for verbose logging

## 📱 PWA Installation

Users can install your game as a Progressive Web App:

1. **Chrome/Edge**: Click the install icon in the address bar
2. **Safari**: Share menu > Add to Home Screen
3. **Mobile**: "Add to Home Screen" prompt should appear

## 🔄 Updates

When you update your game:

1. Commit changes to your repository
2. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy
3. Service Worker will update cached files
4. Users may need to refresh to see changes

## 📊 Analytics (Optional)

To track usage, you can add Google Analytics:

1. Get a Google Analytics tracking ID
2. Add the tracking script to `index.html`
3. Monitor game usage and performance

## 🎯 Performance Tips

1. **Images**: Use optimized images (WebP format when possible)
2. **Audio**: Use compressed audio formats (MP3/OGG)
3. **Code**: The code is already minification-ready
4. **CDN**: External libraries are loaded from CDN for better performance

## 🛡️ Security

The game includes security headers for GitHub Pages:

- Content Security Policy for HTTPS enforcement
- XSS protection
- No inline script vulnerabilities

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Test on different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. Try on both desktop and mobile devices
4. Clear browser cache and cookies if needed

Your escape room game is now ready for the world to enjoy! 🎮
